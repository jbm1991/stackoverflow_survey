## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

If you're using the Anaconda distribution of Python there should be no need to install anything. If you're using the base Python 3.\* installation, then you can install the necessary dependencies with the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

For this project I was interested in using the StackOverflow survey data to understand:

1. Is coding as a hobby more popular with certain demographics?
1. Does the proportion of hobbyists change with education, or employment level?
1. Has it become more popular over time?
1. Are there any tangible benefits to programming as a hobby?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are two Jupyter notebooks, one performs the analysis over the years, and the other performs all of the other analysis. Markdown cells have been used to walkthrough the code.
Additionally there is the `requirements.txt` file which is used to aid in installation.

## Results <a name="results"></a>

My findings can be found [here](https://jbm1991.medium.com/as-a-developer-should-you-code-as-a-hobby-4e3142a048d8)

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>

Thank you to Stack Overflow for conducting the survey and making the results publicly available. Otherwise, there are no restrictions on the use of my code
